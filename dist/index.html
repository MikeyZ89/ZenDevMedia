								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>Welcome to ZenDev Media, Based on the creative entities of ZenDevCo.com, this resource was created for Web Developers to work with Clients, and Clients to work with Web Developers with a sense of Zen.</p>
								<p>The initial idea came from having the gear that produces high quality videos, photos, and branding materials to ultimately help the client engage with their target audiences.</p>
								<p>The focus for us is to make an offering easy for someone who has a long time developer, and wants a fresh take on content or images to utilize for an update on their website or regular content to actively grow their social streams.</p>
								<p>We ask you to get in touch with us, weâ€™re happy to talk about any upcoming projects that you might have or will help you find a package that will best suite your needs or upcoming marketing campaign.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Videography</h2>
								<p>Video is king, videography is the pinnacle of persuasive and engaging content, the vast majority of people are digesting millions of videos everyday.</p>
								<p>There is no argument that Video is here to stay with the hyper sensitive short term memory culture that we all find ourselves in.</p>
								<p>The standard amount of time we have to engage with a potential client or targeted community is about 8 seconds, not a lot of time when you think about it.</p>
								<p>So let me ask you a questions, is there currently quality content on your website or social streams that is helping you keep people engaged with your brand or business?</p>
								<p>Open the dialog for the endless possibilities with Video Marketing and contact us today for a quote on a project or take a look at our packages to get a better understanding on how we can help you grow your online presence.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Photography</h2>
								<p>Photography is a primary piece that even though the overall want for the creative marketing campaign is focused on engaging video content.</p> 
								<p>Photography still holds a very special place, its perfect for building out unique design structure within your website and providing quality images, to introduce yourself, your staff, or perhaps your amazing community.</p>
								<p>As the old saying goes a picture is worth a thousand words, well the same holds true today, we provide packages that provide you a folder of processed, edited images that will help you keep a consistent social thread and help highlight the people and the stories that help show you off.</p>
								<h2 class="major">Branding</h2>
								<p>Branding is the graphic side, from the look of your logo, to the colors we incorporate to a website, this sets the tone for the brand moving forward.</p>
								<p>A very important step that dictates much more than the average folks initially think about.</p>
								<p>Are you planning on doing merchandise? are you planning on doing event spaces where you would need banners and infographics?</p>
								<p>We are here to help not only get you a killer logo after working directly with you to brainstorm the best options to find the best fit, but help you strategize for the growth to come.</p>
